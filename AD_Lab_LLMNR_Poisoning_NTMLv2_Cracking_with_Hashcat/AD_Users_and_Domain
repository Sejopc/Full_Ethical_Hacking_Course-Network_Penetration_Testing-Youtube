The current structure is the following:

Windows 10:
Purpose: Simulate a normal user on the network being connected to Active Directory Domain Controller.
COMPUTER NAME: THE-PUNISHER
LOCAL USER ACCOUNT: Jose Peralta
LOCAL USER PASSWORD: qwaszx12
DOMAIN: marvel.local
Username assigned on Active Directory (under domain marvel.local): fcastle (Frank Castle)
Password assigned to fcastle on AD: Kawaninjazx6r
So, when the user logs in, he will use AD user (fcastle) instead of the local computer user created when Windows was set up.
NOTE: Make sure the DNS Server for this machine is the IP address of AD Machine (Windows 2016), otherwise, it won't be able to authenticate against AD.


Windows 10:
This is the other Win 10 VM Machine, to simulat another AD Users on the network:
COMPUTER NAME: SPIDERMAN

LOCAL USER PASSWORD: qwaszx12
DOMAIN: marvel.local
AD USER: pparker (Peter Parker)

Windows 16:
Purpose: Domain Controller for the Network (where Active Directory is installed). Also used for DNS resolution for the others computers connected to this domain (marvel.local)
COMPUTER NAME: HYDRA

DOMAIN ADMIN USER: Administrator (en espanol)
DOMAIN ADMIN PASSWORD: Kawaninjazx6r

So, when the user logs in, he will use AD user (Administrator) instead of the local computer user created when Windows was set up.
