The current structure is the following:

Windows 10:
Purpose: Simulate a normal user on the network being connected to Active Directory Domain Controller.
COMPUTER NAME: THE-PUNISHER
DOMAIN: marvel.local
Username assigned on Active Directory (under domain marvel.local): fcastle (Frank Castle)
So, when the user logs in, he will use AD user (fcastle) instead of the local computer user created when Windows was set up.



Windows 16:
Purpose: Domain Controller for the Network (where Active Directory is installed). Also used for DNS resolution for the others computers connected to this domain (marvel.local)
COMPUTER NAME: HYDRA
DOMAIN: marvel.local (Forest created on Active Directory on this machine)
Username assigned on Active Directory (under domain marvel.local): Administrator (by default is assigned on the Domain Controller computer)
So, when the user logs in, he will use AD user (Administrator) instead of the local computer user created when Windows was set up.


Kali Linux:
Attacker machine were we will be capturing and poisoning (in order to steal credentials NTLM hashes) LLMNR and NBT-NS requests.
