The current structure is the following:

Windows 10:
Purpose: Simulate a normal user on the network being connected to Active Directory Domain Controller.
COMPUTER NAME: THE-PUNISHER
LOCAL USER ACCOUNT: Jose Peralta
LOCAL USER PASSWORD: qwaszx12
DOMAIN: marvel.local
Username assigned on Active Directory (under domain marvel.local): fcastle (Frank Castle)
Password assigned to fcastle on AD: Kawaninjazx6r
So, when the user logs in, he will use AD user (fcastle) instead of the local computer user created when Windows was set up.
NOTE: Make sure the DNS Server for this machine is the IP address of AD Machine (Windows 2016), otherwise, it won't be able to authenticate against AD.


Windows 10:
This is the other Win 10 VM Machine, to simulat another AD Users on the network:
COMPUTER NAME: SPIDERMAN
LOCAL USER ACCOUNT: Jose
LOCAL USER PASSWORD: qwaszx12
DOMAIN: marvel.local
AD USER: pparker (Peter Parker)
AD PASSWORD: Kawaninjazx6r


Windows 16:
Purpose: Domain Controller for the Network (where Active Directory is installed). Also used for DNS resolution for the others computers connected to this domain (marvel.local)
COMPUTER NAME: HYDRA
DOMAIN: marvel.local (Forest created on Active Directory on this machine)
DOMAIN ADMIN USER: Administrator (en espanol)
DOMAIN ADMIN PASSWORD: Kawaninjazx6r
Username assigned on Active Directory (under domain marvel.local): Administrator (by default is assigned on the Domain Controller computer)
So, when the user logs in, he will use AD user (Administrator) instead of the local computer user created when Windows was set up.


Kali Linux:
Attacker machine were we will be capturing and poisoning (in order to steal credentials NTLM hashes) LLMNR and NBT-NS requests.
